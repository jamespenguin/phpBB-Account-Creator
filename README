This project allows you to automate the process of registering/validating accounts for a phpBB forum board.

To automate CAPTCHA solving using http://decaptcher.com, edit the dc_username and dc_password variables in phpBB.py

NOTE: You may need to adjust the create_account function in phpBB.py if the forum you're trying to register accounts on uses special registration fields.
